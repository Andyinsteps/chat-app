Greetings!
It is I, Antti Hyyti√§inen, delivering my lousy introduction speeches for thee.
I have cometh from the realms of Music Productions, to seek the ancient treasure called "credits".

Jokes aside, I really need those credits, send halp.

I produce rock'n'roll from my bedroom, fuuuuuutuuuure~
From the said bedroom I can also research music theory all days long, thanks covid19!
Think I kinda am engrossed over theory in overall, understanding why and how things are is great. 

I don't have much experience with webs and apps on the dev side, so I'm unsure how this will go, be gentle.
When I grow up I want to be someone who behaves respectably. (with respectable amount of money on my bank account would be a nice plus)

Oh, and I hate phones.

I'll be in your care!
-Antti
